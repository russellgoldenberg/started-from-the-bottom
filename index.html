            <p class='intro-dek'>It has been 39 years since the ABA-NBA merger of 1976. In that time, every team (without exception) has descended to the depths of the rankings. Here is a closer look at the various paths NBA franchises have taken to get from the bottom to the top of league.</p>

                        Let&rsquo;s start by looking at end-of-season rankings based on games won across the league. We will consider a team reaching the <strong class='top'>top</strong> or hitting rock <strong class='bottom'>bottom</strong> if they have of one of the four <strong class='top'>best</strong> or <strong class='bottom'>worst</strong> records, respectively.

                        Since the merger, we have witnessed <strong class='madlib-total'></strong> instances of teams making this journey, which takes <strong class='madlib-median'></strong> season on average to complete.
